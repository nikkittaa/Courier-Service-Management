# Courier-Service-Management
INTRODUCTION:

The courier service system is all about delivering a product/package to its particular destination with the help of the
receiver’s personal details including address. It allows the people to build a wide area connection and send products,
document etc. to their colleagues, relatives and other people within a few days in a cost-efficient manner. A courier
service management system has all the essential features which are required to manage a courier service system in a 
digital way. It stores the information of all the customers and existing orders and easily allows the user to place
more orders.


OBJECTIVE:

The main objective of the project Courier Service Management System is to computerize the data in a courier system that
are recorded manually so as to reduce the redundancy and inconsistency of data. It aims to manage customer details including
their e-mail, phone number, addresses and the details of the orders that they have placed. It is built to provide a portal to 
the customers of the company where they can easily login into their own IDs and have all the details about pre-existing orders. 
They can also place new orders using this program.
It manages the records competently by using MySQL and Python connectivity where MySQL acts as a Database Management system 
which stores all the information of the customers and their orders in the form of databases and Python acts as a tool to form 
a software which act as an interface between user and the company.


SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:

The scope of this project ‘Courier service Management System’ lies in all those courier companies which are looking forward to digitalize their data and want to provide their customers an easy and interactive way to access the information of the orders that they have placed.
Key features of this project are:
•	It is easy to use.
•	It allows the company to cut its cost on storing data manually.
•	It can save companies time and manual labor.
•	It increases the accuracy of data.
•	It is built on the customer end i.e. all the customers can have their accounts.
•	It is secure to use. A person can only have a customer’s information only if he/she knows the user-id and password.
•	The data stored can be easily manipulated.




INPUT/OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

The program takes the following data as input from the user when a new account is created:
•	A suitable username for the account
•	Account’s password
•	Name of the user
•	E-mail address of user
•	Contact number of users
•	Address of the user

It also takes some input from the user when a new order is placed. That information includes:
•	Receiving address of the courier
•	Weight of the courier (as the price is determined using the weight).
•	Payment mode
The information received is then stored in tables using MySQL. A user can have access to this information
(about his/her details or the details of the placed orders) only if he/she is successfully able to login to the account using the correct password.
